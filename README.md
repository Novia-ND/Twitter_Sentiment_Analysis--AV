<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a project made in python which uses NLP algorithm , classification algorithm and clustering algorithm for making this ML model thats predicts whether the text entered tweet Spam or Ham

many algorithms are tested and depending upon the f1 score the best model of classification is selected and used. for clustering we used minibatchkmeans which is very effective for large datasets

also we have a frontend webpages where we integrated ML model into this using Flask micro web frameworks

4. command for running flask server once you have all the required file in same directory assume X directory 
```JS
cd X
django-admin startproject project_name     // to start a new project
